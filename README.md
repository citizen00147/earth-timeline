### :page_with_curl: About This Project

3D design and animation has been an interest of mine for a long time, but I've never had a go at it until now. When I started working on this project, I knew it had to be visual but I wasn't sure if the content would be picture or graphic heavy.

I thought 3D models of Earth, its layers, and other objects would make for a more interactive and visually appealing experience, so I opted for Blender.

I researched how to import models into JavaScript and landed on [three.js](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#manual/en/introduction/Creating-a-scene). Being able to easily animate and add lighting to a scene is a huge plus, and it opened up a lot of possibilies to improve this project.

It's still very much in development; many of the models have been made but are not implemented yet. I have a roadmap outlined [here](https://github.com/users/citizen00147/projects/2)
